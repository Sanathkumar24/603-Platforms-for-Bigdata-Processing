## Q1. Big Data with example and types

>Big Data is a massive amount of information that is expanding exponentially over time. It is a data set that is so huge and complicated that typical data management systems cannot store or analyze it efficiently. Big data is a type of data that is extremely large.

- <strong>Example</strong>: Marketing and Advertising
>Advertisements have traditionally been targeted to various customer groups. In the past, marketers used TV and radio choices, survey results, and focus groups to predict people's reactions to advertisements. These tactics amounted to informed guessing at best. Advertisers now buy or collect massive amounts of data to determine what customers really click on, search for, and "like." Marketing efforts are now analyzed for efficiency using button rates, views, and other exact indicators. Amazon, for example, collects vast amounts of data on the orders, methods of delivery, and payment choices of its billions of customers. The firm then sells highly targeted ad slots to extremely precise groupings and subgroups.

### Types of Big data:
- <strong>Structured</strong>:  Structured data is defined as any information that can be collected, retrieved, and processed in a fixed manner.
- <strong>Unstructured</strong>: Unstructured data is defined as any data having an undetermined shape or structure. Aside from its massive quantity, unstructured data presents a number of issues in terms of processing and extracting value from it. A heterogeneous data source including a mix of basic text files, photos, movies, and so on is an example of unstructured data.
- <strong>Semi-Structured</strong>: Semi-structured data can include both types of information. We can think of semi-structured data as structured in form, but it is not.

## Q2. 6 ‘V’ s of Big Data

<strong>Volume</strong>

The primary element of big data is volume, which is primarily concerned with the connection between quantity and processing capability. This feature is rapidly changing as data collecting increases. Likewise, IT storage and processing capacity.
Example: A high-volume data collection would include all transactions made with credit card on a single day.

<strong>Variety</strong>

The V of variety refers to the vast range of data that has been saved but has yet to be analyzed and examined. New data sources, such as social media and mobile devices, supplement established forms of structured information.
Example: CCTV audio and video recordings generated at many points around a city are an example of a high variety data set.

<strong>Velocity</strong>

The pace at which data is created is referred to as its velocity. High velocity data is created at such a rapid rate that it requires the use of unique processing techniques.
Example: Twitter tweets or Facebook postings are examples of data that is created at a high rate.

<strong>Value</strong>

The value which big data may offer, and it is closely related to what enterprises can accomplish with that data The ability to extract value through big data is required, since the value of big data rises considerably based on the information that can be obtained from it.

<strong>Veracity</strong>

Veracity demonstrates the integrity and source of data, allowing it to be regarded doubtful, contradictory, or impure, and offers information on issues you are unsure how to handle. In a word, the data's validity, and reliability.
Data in volume can cause confusion, but less data can only transmit partial or incomplete information.

<strong>Variability</strong>

Finally, variability: how much and how quickly is the architecture of your data modifying? How frequently does the content or form of your data change?
Example: A soda store may offer six distinct soda mixes, but if you receive the same soda blend daily that taste different, that is variety.
